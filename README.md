Description: It's a Yugioh Card, the illustration of the card shows us a powerful barrier that repels attack.
            In my project, It does the same thing, the particles are coming from all directions and are used as
            "Attack", the user can click wherever they want to generate a barraier that can repel the attack.

Flock/swarm behaviors (totally 5 types): Particle can be attracted by the mouse (same direction). Repel when it hits the
                                    barrier. Come back once it velocity hits 0 during the repel, and move randomly in
                                    certain angle and Separate  once it closes to the position of the mouse.

Objects (totally 4): particle that can be repelled. particle that can't be repelled. particle that will be killed. 
                        The barrier  

Artist statement: Working on it.
