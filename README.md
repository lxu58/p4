Description: It's a Yugioh Card, the illustration of the card shows us a powerful barrier that repels attack.
            In my project, It does the same thing, the particles are coming from all directions and are used as
            "Attack", the user can click wherever they want to generate a barraier that can repel the attack.

Flock/swarm behaviors (totally 5 types): Particle can be attracted by the mouse (same direction). Repel when it hits the
                                    barrier. Come back once it velocity hits 0 during the repel, and move randomly in
                                    certain angle and Separate  once it closes to the position of the mouse.

Objects (totally 4): particle that can be repelled. particle that can't be repelled. particle that will be killed. 
                        The barrier  

Artist statement: Kinda did what I want to do, but I am still thinking about the better coliision function that can be used here, but it really takes time to do more research, so I stopped here to do other homework for my other two courses. Here are some improvment that I could have done: 
    1. keep generate the particle from time to time
    2. make fast-particle, the white one more interactive such as to make it repel, two barriers hits are required
